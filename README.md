# Sentiment-Analysis-using-Python

Executed in Google Colab Notebooks, this project delves into a women's clothing review dataset, employing diverse machine learning techniques to predict customer ratings by analyzing sentiment in the review text.

For this project I used Python. The dataset underwent meticulous preprocessing, involving the removal of NaN records and strategic downsampling for a focused implementation of machine learning techniques. I first started with dummy classifiers to establish a baseline, the project advanced to Logistic Regression coupled with both One-Hot and TF-IDF vectorization. Support Vector Classification (SVC) was also employed alongside these vectorization methods. Diverse Naive Bayes classifier methods were explored for performance insights. I followed it up with parameter tuning methods like grid search to find the optimal set of model parameters and vectorisation parameters as well. 

As a pinnacle, context vectors with BERT, a powerful framework in NLP, were employed to handle ambiguous language where word context is important. Comparative analysis of all models revealed the superior performance of BERT in predicting customer ratings.
